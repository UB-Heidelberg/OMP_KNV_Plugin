# Metadata-Export Tool

The Metadata-Export Tool reads metadata entered into the Open Monograph Press (OMP) and converts it into two XML formats: ONIX (for different book types and different onix versions) and a local scheme defined by the print-on-demand service of KNV.

## Requirements

Following requirements are necessary for the use of the Metadata-Export tool:

* the Python programming language ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)) 

* the Python framework [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download)

* the database [MySQL](https://www.mysql.de/downloads/), based on OMP

## Technologies

Following technologies and software are used in the development of the Metadata-Export tool: XML, ONIX, web2py and Markdown.

### XML

[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) (Extensible Markup Language) is a text-based data format for exchanging hierarchically structured information. The main advantages of XML are easy-readability, simplicity of the syntax and easy adaptability with standardised processing models.

### ONIX

[ONIX](http://home.bic-media.com/index.php/onix-2-1) (Online Information Exchange) is an XML-based data format found by  [EDItEUR](http://www.editeur.org/83/Overview/), an  international organization coordinating development of the standards in e-commerce. ONIX data format is used to exchange bibliographic and product information among publishers, booksellers (e.g. [Amazon.com, Inc.](http://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b?ie=UTF8&node=283155)), libraries and other stakeholders in the book trade.

### web2py

The open source framework [web2py](http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/01/introduction), written in the Python programming language, is used for the development of database-based software. The Python framework web2py includes all the components which are needed to build fully functional web applications.

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simplified and easily readable markup language. Texts written in Markdown language can be automatically converted into other text formats such as PDF, HTML and MS-Word.

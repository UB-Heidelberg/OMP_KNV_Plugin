# Metadata-Export Tool

The Metadata-Export Tool reads metadata entered into the Open Monograph Press (OMP) and converts it into two XML formats: ONIX (for different book types and different onix versions) and a local scheme defined by the print-on-demand service of KNV.

## Requirements

Following requirements are necessary for the use of the Metadata-Export tool:

* the Python programming language ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)) 

* the Python framework [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download)

* the database [MySQL](https://www.mysql.de/downloads/), based on OMP

## Technologies

Following technologies and software are used in the development of the Metadata-Export tool: XML, ONIX, web2py and Markdown.

### XML

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a text-based data format for exchanging hierarchically structured information. The main advantages of XML are easy-readability, simplicity of the syntax and easy adaptability with standardised processing models.

### ONIX

ONIX (Online Information Exchange) is an XML-based data format found by  EDItEUR, an  international organization coordinating development of the standards in e-commerce. ONIX data format is used to exchange bibliographic and product information among publishers, booksellers, libraries and other stakeholders in the book trade.

### web2py

The open source framwork web2py, written in the Python programming language, is used for the development of database-based software. The Python framework web2py includes all the components which are needed to build fully functional web applications.

### Markdown

Markdown is a simplified and easy readable markup language. Texts written in Markdown language can be automatically converted into other text formats such as PDF, HTML and MS-Word.

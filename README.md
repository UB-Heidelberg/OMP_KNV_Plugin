# Metadata-Export Tool

The Metadata-Export Tool reads metadata entered into the Open Monograph Press (OMP) and converts it into two XML formats: ONIX (for different book types and different onix versions) and a local scheme defined by the print-on-demand service of KNV.

## Requirements

Following requirements are necessary for the use of the Metadata-Export tool:

* the Python programming language ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)) 

* the Python framework [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download)

* the database [MySQL](https://www.mysql.de/downloads/), based on OMP

## Technologies

Following technologies and software are used in the development of the Metadata-Export tool: XML, ONIX, web2py, GitHub and Markdown.

### XML

### ONIX

ONIX (Online Information Exchange) is an XML-based data format

* the open source Python framework web2py

* the web-based collaboration tool GitHub

* the simplified markup language Markdown
